**Epic**: E01 - MVP
**Status**: TODO
**Owner**: Developer Agent

## User Story
**As a** user,
**I want to** manage my chat list by deleting conversations,
**So that** I can keep my inbox clean.

---

## Requirements Covered
- [R13] Soft delete conversation for specific user.

---

## Technical Context
*   Conversations are per-user pointers to the chat history.
*   "Deleting" a conversation just hides it from the list. It does NOT delete the messages for the other person.
*   If a new message arrives, the conversation should reappear.

---

## API Contracts

### DELETE /conversations/:type/:targetId
**Context**: `type` is "dm" or "group". `targetId` is the UUID of the user or group.
**Response (200)**:
```json
{ "success": true }
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **AC1**: Deleting a conversation removes it from `GET /conversations`.
- [ ] **AC2**: Messages are NOT deleted from the database.
- [ ] **AC3**: If I receive a new message in that conversation, it reappears in my list.
